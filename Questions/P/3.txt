It is easier to roll a stone up a sloping road than to lift it vertical upwards because
1. work done in rolling is more than in lifting
2. work done in lifting the stone is equal to rolling it
3. work done in rolling a stone is less than in lifting it
4. work done in both is same but the rate of doing work is less in rolling
